## Exercise 1
The EfficientNet architecture needs to be described in detail and thoroughly explain all its concepts and innovations.

## Exercise 2
The ResNext and the Inception-ResNet should be compared and discussed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.

## Exercise 3
In this part, you will use a ResNet architecture to solve an imagery classification problem. You have to work with the Intel Image Classification, which consists of 6 classes with 25k samples.<br/>
