## Exercise 1
Describe in detail how L1 regularization differs from L2 regularization, and which one do you
prefer?<br/> 
∙ In addition, please describe intuitively how each affects the model weights. <br/>

## Exercise 2
In this part, you will implement a simple multi-layer perceptron neural network using PyTorch
to solve a clothing classification problem. You have to work with the Fashion MNIST dataset,
which consists of 10 classes with 60,000 examples in the training set and 10,000 examples in
the test set.

∙ Report the depth effect of different hidden layers.<br/> 
∙ Analyze the dropout technique and report its results.<br/> 
∙ Use early stopping criteria.<br/> 
∙ Become familiar with batch normalization and report its effects.<br/> 
∙ The model should be tested for L1 and L2 regularization.<br/>
